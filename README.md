_Fruits vs Vegetables – AI-powered Image Classifier_

**VeggieeVission** is an interactive AI web app where users can hold a fruit or vegetable in front of their webcam, and the app will classify the item in real-time using a trained model built with [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
